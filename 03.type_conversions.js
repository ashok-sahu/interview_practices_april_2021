/*
The process of converting one data type to another data type is called type conversion. There are two types of type conversion in JavaScript.

1).Implicit Conversion
2).Explicit Conversion

[].JavaScript Implicit Conversion
In certain situations, JavaScript automatically converts one data type to another (to the right type). This is known as implicit conversion.

[].JavaScript Explicit Conversion
You can also convert one data type to another as per your needs. The type conversion that you do manually is known as explicit type conversion.
In JavaScript, explicit type conversions are done using built-in methods.

//implicit convrsion of string
/*
//[].When a number is added to a string, JavaScript converts the number to a string before concatenation.


let result;
result = "1" + 1;//11
console.log(result)
result = "1" + null;//1null
console.log(result);
result = "1" + undefined;//1undefined
console.log(result);
result = "1" + true; //1true
console.log(result);

//.Implicit Conversion to Number
let result;
result = "4" - "2";//2
console.log(result)
result = "4" - 2;//2
console.log(result)
result = "4"/2;//2
console.log(result)
result = "4"*2//8
console.log(result)


//Non-numeric String Results to NaN
let result;
result = "hello" - "world";//NaN
console.log(result);
result = "4" - "world"//NaN
console.log(result);


//Implicit Boolean Conversion to Number
